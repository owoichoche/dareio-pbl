# Web Solution with Wordpress
In this lesson, we shall be building a web solution with Wordpress, leveraging on the 3-tier architecture which comprises of the following:
1. The Presentation Layer - This refers to the user interface and will be acessed by a browser on the Client Computer.
2. The Business or Application Layer - This is the backend program that implements the business logic. This will be represented with the Web Server. 
3. The Data Access or Management Layer - This is the layer of data storage and data access. Usually, a database Server is used for this purpose.

#### Note: We will be using RedHat Linux for this project
